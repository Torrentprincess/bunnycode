        <h2>What is html?</h2> <br>
        <p>HTML is the language used to create the web pages you visit everyday. It provides a logical way to structure content for web pages.</p> <br>
        <p>Let's analyze the acronym "HTML", as it contains a lot of useful information. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.</p> <br>
        <p>Doctype: A web browser must know what language a document is written in before they can process the contents of the document. You can let web browsers know that you are using the HTML language by starting your HTML document with a document type declaration.</p> <br>
        <p>The declaration is the following:&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</p> <br>
        <p>HTML: The &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; declaration is only the beginning, however. It only tells the browser that you plan on using HTML in the document, it doesn't actually add any HTML structure or content.</p> <br>
        <p>To begin adding HTML structure and content, we must first add opening and closing &lt;html&gt;tags, like so: &lt;html&gt; &lt;/html&gt;</p> <br>
        <p>Anything between &lt;html&gt; and &lt;/html&gt; will be considered HTML code. Without these tags, it's possible that browsers could incorrectly interpret your HTML code and present HTML content in unexpected ways.</p> <br>
        <p>Head: The &lt;head&gt; element will contain information about the page that isn't displayed directly on the actual web page:&lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt;</p> <br>
        <p>Title: The browser displays the title of the page because the title can be specified directly inside of the &lt;head&gt; element, by using a &lt;title&gt; &lt;/title&gt; element.</p> <br>
        <p>Body: Before we can add content that a browser will display, we have to add a body to the HTML file.Once the file has a body, many different types of content can be added within the body, like text, images, buttons, and much more:&lt;body&gt; &lt;/body&gt;</p> <br>
