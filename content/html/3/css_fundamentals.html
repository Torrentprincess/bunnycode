        <h2>CSS Fundamentals</h2>
        <p>Style:The &lt;style&gt; element allows you to write CSS code between its opening and closing tags. To use the  &lt;style&gt; element, it must be placed inside of the head using &lt;style&gt; &lt;/style&lt;</p>
        <p>Linking the CSS file: You can use the < link > element to link the HTML and CSS files together. The &lt;link&gt; element must be placed within the head of the HTML file. It is a self-closing tag and requires the following three attributes: href, type, rel. When linking an HTML file and a CSS file together, the < link > element will look like the following: &lt;link href="/style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;</p>
        <p>Element Selectors: To style an HTML element using CSS, you must first select that element in the CSS file, all paragraph elements are selected using a CSS selector. The CSS selector essentially matches the HTML tag for that element, but without the angle brackets.</p>
        <p>Multiple Element Selectors: Styling with CSS would be very inefficient if you were forced to manually style the same property across many elements.Fortunately, you can select multiple elements at once so that you can save time styling a shared property.</p>
        <p>Comments: Just like HTML, you can also leave comments in your CSS file. CSS comments begin with /* and end with */.</p>
