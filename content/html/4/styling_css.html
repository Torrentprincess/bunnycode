        <h1>Lesson 4: Styling with css</h1>
        

        <h2>HTML content</h2> <br>
        <p>Headings: Headings in HTML can be likened to headings in other types of media. For example, in newspapers, large headings are typically used to capture a reader's attention. Other times, headings are used to describe content, like the title of a movie or an educational article using &lt;h1 &gt; &lt;/h1&gt; (alternative, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6)</p> <br>
        <p>Paragraphs: Paragraphs are great for expanding the amount of content (text) on your web page. As you begin to add more text to your web page, however, keep in mind that large amounts of text in paragraph format can overwhelm web page visitors. For example, if multiple paragraphs on your web page each contain large amounts of text, your web page could become difficult to consume using < p >< /p ></p> <br>
        <p>Unordered lists:In HTML, you can use the unordered list for text you decide to format in bullet points. An unordered list outlines individual list items with a bullet point. You've probably used an unordered list when writing down a grocery list or school supplies list. List can be created using the < ul > element and all individual list items can be added using < li  elements.</p> <br>
        <p>Ordered lists: Ordered lists are like unordered lists, except that each list item is numbered. You can create the ordered list with the < ol > element and then add individual list items to the list using < li > elements.</p> <br>
        <p>Links: You can add links to a web page by adding an anchor element < a > and including the text of the link in between the opening and closing tags using &lt;a href=""&gt; &lt;/a &gt;  &lt;/p&gt; </p> <br>
        <p>Target and Blank: For a link to open in a new window, the target attribute requires a value of _blank. The target attribute can be added directly to the opening tag of the anchor element, just like the href attribute using &lt;a href="" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;</p> <br> 
        <p>Images: The  &lt;img&gt; element lets you add images to a web page. This element is special because it does not have a closing tag, it only has an opening tag. This is because the &lt;img&gt; element is a self-closing element using &lt;img src="https://www.example.com/picture.jpg"&gt;</p> <br>
        <p>Different types of linking: HTML allows you to turn nearly any element into a link by wrapping that element with an anchor element. With this technique, it's possible to turn images into links by simply wrapping the &lt;img&gt; element with an &lt;a&gt;  element using &lt;a href="" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;img src="#" alt=""&gt;  &lt;/a&gt; </p> <br>
        <p>Line Breaks: The line break element is one self-closing tag. You can use it anywhere within your HTML code and a line break will be shown in the browser using  &lt;br/&gt;  </p> <br>
        <p>Comments: Comments begin with &lt;!-- and end with --.&gt; Any characters in between will be treated as a comment.</p> <br>
        <h2>Including comments in your code is helpful for several reasons: </h2><br>
            <p>They help you (and others) understand your code if you decide to come back and review it at a much later date.</p> <br>
            <p>They allow you to experiment with new code, without having to delete old code.</p>
