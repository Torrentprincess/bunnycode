        <h2>Foreground and Background</h2>
        <p>In CSS, these two design aspects can be styled with the following two properties:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>color - this property styles an element's foreground color.</li>
            <li>background-color - this property styles an element's background color.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Named Colors: In CSS, these colors are technically known as named colors. There are a total of 147 named colors, such as Red, Blue, Cyan, Crimson, Etc.</p>
        <p>RGB Colors: Although named colors provide 147 different options, this is a small amount when you consider the flexibility of CSS. To take advantage of the full spectrum of colors that CSS supports, you have the option of using RGB colors.To use RGB colors, you can use the rgb() value when styling a color.</p>
        <p>Alpha Value a: Opacity is a measure of how transparent a color is. To modify opacity in RGB colors, CSS offers the rgba() value. Note the slight difference in rgb() and rgba(). The extra a character in the rgba() value is known as the alpha value. It represents the opacity of a color. The alpha value can be a number between 0 or 1, inclusive.</p>
        <p>Font family: When setting typefaces on a web page, keep the following points in mind:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The font specified in a stylesheet must be installed on a user's computer in order for that font to display when a user visit the web page.</li>
            <li>How exactly does the browser know what typeface to use when displaying the web page? The default typeface for all HTML elements is Times New Roman.</li>
            <li>When the name of a typeface consists of more than one word, it must be enclosed in double quotes (otherwise it will not be recognized).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Fallback Fonts: Most computers have a small set of typefaces pre-installed. This small set includes serif fonts and sans-serif fonts, like Times New Roman and Arial, respectively.When the stylesheet specifies a font not installed on a user's computer, the pre-installed fonts can be used as fallback fonts for users.</p>
        <p>Font weight: It's common to bold important headings or keywords. In CSS, the font-weight property turns bold on or off.</p>
        <p>Line height: Text on a web page must also be easy to read. When text is styled to appear larger, the vertical spacing between lines of text can decrease, creating text that is difficult to read, particularly in paragraphs. To avoid this problem, you can modify the spacing between lines of text with the line-height property.</p>
        <p>Text alignment: To move, or align, text, we can use the text-align property. The text-align property can be set to one of the following three values:<br>
        1. left - aligns text to the left hand side of the browser.<br>
        2. center - centers text.<br>
        3. right - aligns text to the right hand side of the browser.
