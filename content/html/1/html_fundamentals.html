        <h2>Organizing HTML and CSS</h2>
        <p>IDs: HTML: With the proper labels, we can style individual HTML elements! Specifically, we can label HTML elements with a unique identifier, or ID. We can then style that specific element in the stylesheet. To label an element with an ID, we can use the id attribute on an HTML element.</p>
        <p>ID selectors: CSS: To style a specific element labeled with an ID, you can use an ID selector in the stylesheet. All ID selectors begin with the octothorpe character: #. The value of the ID </p>
        <p>Classes: HTML: CSS offers a solution to this limitation. For multiple elements that should share the same styling, classes can be used to label them. To label an element with a class, we can use the class attribute on an HTML element.</p>
        <p>Class Selectors 1: CSS: we can style elements belonging to the same class at once. How exactly do you select them in CSS, though?. To style elements of the same class, you can use a class selector in the stylesheet.</p>
        <p>Class Selectors 2: CSS: A heading and a paragraph (both with a class of breaking) may need to share the same typeface, but the paragraph may require a styling better suited for paragraphs, as in the following example.</p>
        <p>Multiple selectors: CSS: CSS does not limit you to selectors that target a single element or class. The same syntax can be used to style multiple classes at once.</p>
        <p>Multiple classes: HTML: It's also possible to label HTML elements with more than one class. How is this functionality useful?. When those same elements must also be differentiated, however, labeling with an additional class is helpful.</p>
        <p>The div: HTML offers an element that is the backbone of code organization: the div, represented by &lt;div&gt; in HTML. You can think of the div as a box, or container, that groups elements that belong together. For example, a &lt;div&gt; can be used to group together all of the elements that make up the navigation for a web page, or any other section of a page.</p>
        <p>Divs and Classes: This does not mean that labeling individual elements with classes is no longer useful. Even when divs are labeled with classes, there will be many other times when an individual element will need to be labeled with a class. When a div is styled, all elements inside of the div will inherit the styling applied to the div. </p>
