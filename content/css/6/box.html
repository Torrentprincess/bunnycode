    <h1>Lesson 6: The CSS Box Model </h1>
        <p>All HTML elements live within a <b>box</b>. Elements on a web page are understood by the browser as "living" inside of a container, or a box. This is what is meant by the box model. To truly create custom websites, you'll have to understand the box model.</p>
    
    <h2>Dimensions & Units of Measurement</h2>
        <p>An element's box has two dimensions: a height and a width. These two properties can be specified with the following units of measurement:</p>
            <h3>Pixels</h3>
                <p>This unit lets you set the exact size of an element's box.</p>
            <h3>Ems</h3>
                <p>This unit sets the dimensions of the box relative to the size of the text within the box.</p>
            <h3>Percentages</h3>
                <p>We can define number values more fluidly with percentage units. Percentages, by nature, are always relative to something else. When we use a percentage unit in CSS, the percentage value is measured relative to a parent element's length.</p>
    
    <h2>Minimum & Maximum</h2>
        <p>A minimum and maximum width or height can be set for a box. This helps ensure that content remains legible when a user shrinks or expands their browser window.</p>
            <h3>min-width/height</h3>
                <p>This property ensures a minimum width for an element's box.</p>
            <h3>max-width/height</h3>
                <p>this property ensures a maximum width for an element's box.</p>
    <h2>Overflow</h2>
    <p>The overflow property controls what happens to content when it spills, or overflows, outside of its box. It can be set to one of the following values:</p>
            <h3>hidden</h3>
                <p>When set to this value, any content that overflows be hidden from view.</p>
            <h3>scroll</h3>
                <p>The overflow is clipped, but a scroll-bar is added to see the rest of the content.</p>
