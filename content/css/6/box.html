<p><a name="box"></a>All HTML elements live within a box. Elements on a web page are understood by the browser as "living" inside of a container, or a box. This is what is meant by the box model.To truly create custom websites, you'll have to understand the box model.<br>
An element's box has two dimensions: a height and a width.These two properties can be specified with the following units of measurement:<br>
pixels-This unit lets you set the exact size of an element's box.<br>
Ems - This unit sets the dimensions of the box relative to the size of the text within the box.<br>
Percentages-We can define number values more fluidly with percentage units. Percentages, by nature, are always relative to something else. When we use a percentage unit in CSS, the percentage value is measured relative to a parent element's length.<br>
 A minimum and maximum width or height can be set for a box. This helps ensure that content remains legible when a user shrinks or expands their browser window<br>
 min-width/height - this property ensures a minimum width for an element's box.<br>
 max-width/height - this property ensures a maximum width for an element's box.<br>
 The overflow property controls what happens to content when it spills, or overflows, outside of its box. It can be set to one of the following values:
 hidden - when set to this value, any content that overflows be hidden from view.
 scroll- The overflow is clipped, but a scroll-bar is added to see the rest of the content
