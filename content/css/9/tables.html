<p><a name="tables"></a> The < table > element will contain all of the tabular data you plan on displaying, allows you to arrange data like text, images, links, other tables, etc, into rows and columns of cells.<br>
The basic structure of an HTML table consists of the following tags:<br>
Table tags:  < table > < /table ><br>
Row tags:   < tr> < /tr ><br>
Cell tags:    < td> < /td ><br>
Constructing an HTML table consists of describing the table between the beginning table tag, < table >, and the ending table table tag, < /table >. Between these tags, you then construct each row and each cell in the row. To do this, you would first start the row with the beginning row tag, < tr >, and then build the row by creating each cell with the beginning cell tag, < td >, adding the data for that cell, and then closing the cell with the ending cell tag, < /td >. When you finish all of the cells for a row, you would then close the row with the ending row tag, < /tr >.Then, for each new row, you would repeat the process of beginning the row, building each cell in the row, and closing the row.
