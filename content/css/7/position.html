    <h1>Lesson 7: Position</h1>
<h2>The default position of an element can be changed by setting its position property. The position property can take one of four values:</h2> <br>
<p>Static: The default value (it does not need to be specified)</p> <br>
<p>Relative: Relative behaves the same as static unless you add some extra properties.</p> <br>
<p>Abosulute: When an element's position is set to absolute, all other elements on the page will ignore the element and act like it is not present on the page.</p> <br>
<p>Fixed: A fixed element is positioned relative to the viewport, it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. As with relative, the top, right, bottom, and left properties are used.</p> <br>
<h2>If you're simply interested in moving an element as far left or as far right as possible on the page, you can use the float property which can be set to one of the two values.</h2> <br>
<p>Left: This value will move, or float, elements as far left as possible.</p> <br>
<p>Right: This value will move elements as far right as possible.</p> <br>
<p>When multiple floated elements have different heights, this can affect their layout on the page. Specifically, elements can "bump" into each other and not allow other elements to properly move the left or or the right.</p> <br>
<h2>The clear property specifies how elements should behave when they bump into each other on the page. It can take on one of the following values:</h2> <br>
<p>Left: The left side of the element will not touch any other element within the same containing element.</p> <br>
<p>Right: The right side of the element will not touch any other element within the same containing element.</p> <br>
<p>Both: Neither side of the element will touch any other element within the same containing element.</p> <br>
<p>None: The element can touch either side.</p>
