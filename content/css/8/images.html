<p>The < img > is an empty tag  which defines an image in an HTML page. It can contain only list of attributes and it has no closing tag.</p>
<p>Image dimensions are set using the width and height properties. Specifying the dimensions of an image helps the browser determine how much space should be reserved for the image.</p>
<p>By default, images are inline elements. For images to center properly, they must behave as block-level elements.</p>
 <p>Images can also be added to the backgrounds of HTML elements with the background-image property.</p>
<p>The background-image can be set to a value of url().</p>
<p>url() - contains the URL of the image, enclosed in double quotes.<br>
The background-repeat CSS property defines how background images are repeated. A background image can be repeated along the horizontal axis, the vertical axis, both axes, or not repeated at all. This property can take one of four values:</p>
<ol>
<li>repeat - the default value, the image will repeat horizontally and vertically.</li>
<li>repeat-x - the background image will be repeated only along the x-axis (horizontally).</li>
<li>repeat-y - the background image will be repeated only along the y-axis (vertically).</li>l
<li>no-repeat - the background image will not be repeated at all and will appear only once.</li>
<p>The position of a non-repeating image can be controlled using the background-position property. It is positioned using a 3 by 3 grid (three rows, three columns), meaning there are 9 total possible positions for the image:</p>
<ol>
<li>left top - top left corner of the element's box.</li>
<li>center top - top center of the element's box.</li>
<li>right top - top right corner of the element's box.</li>
<li>left center - left column, center row.</li>
<li>center center - the center of the element's box.</li>
<li>right center - right column, center row.</li>
<li>left bottom - bottom left corner of the element's box.</li>
<li>center bottom - bottom center of the element's box.</li>
<li>right bottom - bottom right corner of the element's box.</li>
