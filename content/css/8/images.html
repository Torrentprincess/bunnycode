<p><a name="images"></a> The < img > is an empty tag  which defines an image in an HTML page. It can contain only list of attributes and it has no closing tag.<br>
Image dimensions are set using the width and height properties. Specifying the dimensions of an image helps the browser determine how much space should be reserved for the image.<br>
 By default, images are inline elements. For images to center properly, they must behave as block-level elements.
 Images can also be added to the backgrounds of HTML elements with the background-image property.<br>
The background-image can be set to a value of url().<br>
url() - contains the URL of the image, enclosed in double quotes.<br>
The background-repeat CSS property defines how background images are repeated. A background image can be repeated along the horizontal axis, the vertical axis, both axes, or not repeated at all. This property can take one of four values:<br>
repeat - the default value, the image will repeat horizontally and vertically.<br>
repeat-x - the background image will be repeated only along the x-axis (horizontally).<br>
repeat-y - the background image will be repeated only along the y-axis (vertically).<br>
no-repeat - the background image will not be repeated at all and will appear only once.<br>
The position of a non-repeating image can be controlled using the background-position property. It is positioned using a 3 by 3 grid (three rows, three columns), meaning there are 9 total possible positions for the image:<br>
left top - top left corner of the element's box.<br>
center top - top center of the element's box.<br>
right top - top right corner of the element's box.<br>
left center - left column, center row.<br>
center center - the center of the element's box.<br>
right center - right column, center row.<br>
left bottom - bottom left corner of the element's box.<br>
center bottom - bottom center of the element's box.<br>
right bottom - bottom right corner of the element's box.<br>
