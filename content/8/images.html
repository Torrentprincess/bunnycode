<h1>Lesson 8: Images</h1>
<h2>The < img > is an empty tag  which defines an image in an HTML page. It can contain only list of attributes and it has no closing tag.</h2> <br>
<p>Image dimensions are set using the width and height properties. Specifying the dimensions of an image helps the browser determine how much space should be reserved for the image.
 By default, images are inline elements. For images to center properly, they must behave as block-level elements.
 Images can also be added to the backgrounds of HTML elements with the background-image property.</p> <br>
<p>The background-image can be set to a value of url().</p> <br>
<h2>url() - contains the URL of the image, enclosed in double quotes.<br> 
The background-repeat CSS property defines how background images are repeated. A background image can be repeated along the horizontal axis, the vertical axis, both axes, or not repeated at all. This property can take one of four values:</h2> <br>
<p>Repeat: The default value, the image will repeat horizontally and vertically.</p> <br> 
<p>Repeat-x: The background image will be repeated only along the x-axis (horizontally).</p> <br>
<p>Repeat-y: The background image will be repeated only along the y-axis (vertically).</p> <br> 
<p>No-repeat: The background image will not be repeated at all and will appear only once.</p> <br>
<h2>The position of a non-repeating image can be controlled using the background-position property. It is positioned using a 3 by 3 grid (three rows, three columns), meaning there are 9 total possible positions for the image:</h2> <br>
<p>Left top: Top left corner of the element's box.</p> <br>
<p>Center top: Top center of the element's box.</p> <br>
<p>Right top: Top right corner of the element's box.</p> <br>
<p>Left center: Left column, center row.</p> <br>
<p>Center center: The center of the element's box.</p> <br>
<p>Right center: Right column, center row.</p> <br>
<p>Left bottom: Bottom left corner of the element's box.</p> <br>
<p>Center bottom: Bottom center of the element's box.</p> <br>
<p>Right bottom: Bottom right corner of the element's box.</p>
